# ZigZag


ZigZag strategy as defined by Bruno Matos on Quora 


On Quora Bruno Matos asked the question:

Considering that prices zigzag, could this trading strategy be profitable in the long-term? Target 1 to 4 ticks, Buy if a 5m candle closes negative, and sell if 5m candle closes. If the candle closes against you, you average the position.

Interesting idea. It might work in more of a HFT system.

On a system that is looking at 5 minute bars with Profit/Loss checks every minute to determine if it is working this strategy most likely won’t work too well.

Conclusion: This strategy never had a winning day when tested with the Dow 30 stocks for all of January through June 2017.
